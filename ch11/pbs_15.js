/*Write a function that returns the average value of an arbitrarily long array of numbers. 
Use that function to average up to three numbers entered in the input fields in the PBS playground, and print out the result.
Your solution should also behave sensibly if the user executes 
the code without entering values into any of the inputs.
In case youâ€™re a little rusty, just a reminder that you calculate the average of a set of numbers 
by adding them all together, and then dividing the result of that addition by the amount of numbers being 
averaged.
